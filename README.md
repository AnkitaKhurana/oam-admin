# oam-admin

Frontend for OpenAerialMap Administration

OpenAerialMap (OAM) is a set of tools for searching, sharing, and using openly licensed satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery.

However, to get all functionality you will also need to point it at a running OAM-API. By default the endpoint of the staging instance of the API will be used, however you can change the endpoint to a locally running API in src/config/local.js
